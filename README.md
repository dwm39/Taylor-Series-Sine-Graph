# Taylor Series Sine Grpah

## OVERVIEW
This program uses Scene Builder, Java, and JavaFX to create an interactive interface displaying a changeable XY Chart. The user is asked to input the domain and then asked the number of terms wanted in the Taylor Series Aproximation. Then the corresponding approximation graph is called along with the actual sine graph to see the difference. There is also an option to append the graphs to see the difference between the approximations aswell. There is also a description bos that dsiplays each step in the Approximation.


### How to Run
User can click the different interactive buttons on the API when running the class called FinalGraph.java

### Software
